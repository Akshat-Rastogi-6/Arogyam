The pressure of placement season, coupled with the demanding nature of your college program, is understandably taking a toll.

The fact that you recognize your own capabilities is a significant strength.  Let's focus on building upon that.  Can you share some examples of your skills and accomplishments?  Reminding yourself of your strengths can be a powerful antidote to negative self-perception.\n",

When you feel like a failure, let's examine the evidence for and against that belief.  Often, our thoughts aren't entirely objective, and we can learn to reframe them in a more balanced and realistic way.\n",

If you experience any difficulties while you're in India, don't hesitate to seek support.  Your mental health is just as important as your physical health.  Taking proactive steps to maintain your well-being is a sign of strength.\n"
