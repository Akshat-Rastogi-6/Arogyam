Always consult a medical professional before relying solely on home remedies.\n",

Often, these thoughts are distortions of reality.\n",

This can help ground you in the present moment and reduce feelings of being suffocated.  Even a few minutes of mindful breathing can make a difference.\n",

They can offer personalized strategies and support to help you manage your stress and depression.\n",
